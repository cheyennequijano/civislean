- Come up with list of features
    - survival civilization building game
        - based on virtual villagers series
    - top down view
    - environment has default objects such as fire pit
    - start with a few people, each have bars
        - hunger (function of time, affected by consuming food in the environment, activities vs. idling)
        - health (hunger status, sickness, shelter, weather)
        - thirst
        - happiness
        - strength
    - community resources
        - food
            - people stress if not enough
        - technology
            - better jobs, able to explore more (e.g. religion, lab)
    - lose the game if all people die (no health, hunger, etc.)
    - statistics are affected by the environment
    - people interact with objects in the environment (tasks)
        - building (fire, shelter, others)
            - require multiple people
            - list of people required
        - gathering resources (fishing, stockpile/storage, resource system)
            - assign task, animation, come out with resources
        - farming, gathering
        - environmental entities
            - crops, wild food sources (mushrooms, berries)
        - cooking (raw food to edible food)
        - exploring (ruins, treasure, etc.)
        - inputs 
            - human, environment, time
        - outputs
            - reduce food, get sick, add buildings, increase stockpile
        - can decide their tasks, default tasks, can override yours (e.g. stress if low food stockpile), certain tasks you can/cannot assign
    - resources
        - raw food, edible food, water
        - stone, wood
    - random events that trigger event modifiers
        - every day/game tick has a chance of a random event occurring
    - jobs for villagers (fishermen, builder, farmer, healer, parent)
        - can level up, faster at job
        - some way to determine what they do when idle, whether through assigning as a player or randomly assigning based on skill level
    - villagers age
        - babies (0-1), children (2-13), adults (13+)
    - villagers populate by task (make baby)
        - one man, one woman
        - can have twins
    - infinite amount of each entity
    - happiness (people work faster)
        - lagoon
        - religion
        - burial
    - later features
        - exploration of island
        - religion
        - markets
        - crime
- Come up with the order in which we will implement the features--so a list of goals
    - Describe a minimum viable product to work toward
- Make a design plan
- start coding
